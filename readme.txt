Moves all club data from a site with the "Extra Child" theme to a site with PuppyPress, remapping every ID.

== Description ==

Exports stud dogs, pedigrees, litters, dogs to place, approvals, breeding licenses, results, shows, trimming proofs, dog sitters, literature, kennels, breeders, owners, media, posts, pages, menus, comments and widgets into one ZIP package and imports it into another site. All references between records are rewritten to the new IDs.

Works in resumable steps (no timeouts), never duplicates records when run twice, never overwrites existing files and validates every file in the package. Includes WP-CLI commands.

== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin on the old and on the new site.
2. On the new site, activate PuppyPress as well.
3. Old site: Tools → PuppyPress Migration → Create export.
4. New site: Tools → PuppyPress Migration → upload the ZIP → Start import.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
